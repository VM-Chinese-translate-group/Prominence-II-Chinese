Keep in mind this is not allowed, both Prominent and Prominence have a strict license that does not allow redistribution or public modification, making this either an illegal reupload of Prominence, or a an illegal redistribution of Prominent, as Prominent is not available through CurseForge, so you're also breaking the license of Prominent by overriding the file within the modpack.
