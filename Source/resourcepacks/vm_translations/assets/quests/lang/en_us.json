There are two type of neutrons, fast and thermal : the fast carry energy while the thermal do not.

 "ftbquests.chapter.modern_industrialization.quests64.description16": "When a neutron encounters a non-empty hatch, two things can happen : the neutron is absorbed or scattered. A scattered neutron will randomly change direction. If the scattered neutron is fast, it has a chance of slowing down, becoming a thermal one.

When reached, the item is either destroyed or transformed into a depleted version.

 "ftbquests.chapter.modern_industrialization.quests64.description26": "The same thing happens for fluids: a bit of fluid is transformed after each neutron absorption. This can be used to mass produce useful isotopes like deuterium and tritium. In both cases, the outcome is shown in REI.",
